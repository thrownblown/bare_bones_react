## Documentation

To get started simply download or clone the repository into a folder of your liking.  Make you you have NodeJS installed and run

> `npm install`

### Development Mode

To run the dev server environment

> `npm run buildDev`

### Production Build

To build production files for the built in NodeJS/ExpressJS web application

> `npm run build`

The server folder is the Node/ExpressJS application.  This is where you will extend your api.  To run your production Node environment (as you would on a server) CD into the server folder. 

Make sure your node_modules are installed

> `npm install`

Now fire up the server

> `node index.js`

You now have a hot reloading, client side developoment environment able to communicate with your backend ExpressJS web server which mimics the production environment.   When both apps are running Express will pick up on your JS changes as the webpack development server builds them.
